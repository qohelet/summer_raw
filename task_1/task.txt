Task:
A turtle should move to another turtle

Definition:
The task is pretty the same as a previous one.
There are two objects (two turtles). Your task is to make one turtle move to
another. For solving this task you have to know following notes:
1) Simulation is provided by turtlesim
	rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node

2) In turtlesim there have to be two turtles with names:
	turtle1
	victim
And victim should move to turtle1

3) Poses of turtle1 victim could be read from topics /turtle1/pose and
/victim/pose. Structure of messages from these topics you could see typing 
in terminal:
	rosmsg show turtlesim/Pose
This could be imported to python code with:
	from turtlesim.msg import Pose

4) Command messages should be published in topic /victim/cmd_vel. Structure of
messages from this topic you could see typing in terminal:
	rosmsg show geometry_msgs/Twist
Pay your attention that there are only two fields in this structure:
	Vector3 linear
	Vector3 angular
And each of them have three own fields (x,y,z)

5) To spawn new turtle you have to call service /spawn
(with [x, y, theta, name] parameters)
You could do it in two ways:
a) In python by spawn_func = rospy.ServiceProxy("/spawn",Spawn)
                spawn_func(x,y,theta,"<name>")
   Don't forget to imoprt
                from turtlesim.srv import Spawn
b) in terminal call rosservice call /spawn x y theta "<name>"
